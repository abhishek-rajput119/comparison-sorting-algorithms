# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This React application allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action.
You can see how each algorithm works by observing the real-time visualization of the sorting process.

## Introduction

This application provides a visual representation of the following sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Shell Sort

Each sorting algorithm has its own visualization component, allowing you to observe the step-by-step process of sorting.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/abhishek-rajput119/comparison-sorting-algorithms.git

   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd comparison-sorting-algorithms

   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Usage

1. Select a sorting algorithm from the  menu.
2. Adjust the speed and size of the visualization using the controls provided.
3. Observe the real-time visualization of the chosen sorting algorithm.
